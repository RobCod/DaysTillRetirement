Handy little bash script to tell you how many days until retirement you have


How to use:

1. Edit the script with the date you want to retire and save the script.
2. open a terminal where you stored the shell file and type `./DaysTillRetirement`.
3. If you want the script to run when you login just place it in your `/etc/profile.d` folder.


If it won't run just open up a terminal and type chmod +x `DaysTillRetirement` and hit enter
